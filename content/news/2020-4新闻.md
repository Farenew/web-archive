## Attackers Can Bypass Fingerprint Authentication With an 80 Percent Success Rate

`2020-4-8`

An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica:

> A study published on Wednesday by Cisco's Talos security group makes clear that the alternative isn't suitable for everyone -- namely those who may be targeted by nation-sponsored hackers or other skilled, well-financed, and determined attack groups. The researchers spent about $2,000 over several months testing fingerprint authentication offered by Apple, Microsoft, Samsung, Huawei, and three lock makers. The result: on average, fake fingerprints were able to bypass sensors at least once roughly 80 percent of the time.

The percentages are based on 20 attempts for each device with the best fake fingerprint the researchers were able to create. While Apple Apple products limit users to five attempts before asking for the PIN or password, the researchers subjected the devices to 20 attempts (that is, multiple groups of from one or more attempts). Of the 20 attempts, 17 were successful. Other products tested permitted significantly more or even an unlimited number of unsuccessful tries. Tuesday's report was quick to point out that the results required several months of painstaking work, with more than 50 fingerprint molds created before getting one to work. The study also noted that the demands of the attack -- which involved obtaining a clean image of a target's fingerprint and then getting physical access to the target's device -- meant that only the most determined and capable adversaries would succeed.
The most susceptible devices were the AICase padlock and Huawei's Honor 7x and Samsung's Note 9 Android phones, "all of which were bypassed 100 percent of the time," the report says. "Fingerprint authentication in the iPhone 8, MacBook Pro 2018, and the Samsung S10 came next, where the success rate was more than 90 percent. Five laptop models running Windows 10 and two USB drives -- the Verbatim Fingerprint Secure and the Lexar Jumpdrive F35 -- performed the best, with researchers achieving a 0-percent success rate."

## Trump Threatens To Withhold Funding For World Health Organization 

`2020-4-7`

What better way to celebrate World Health Day than by threatening to withhold funding for the World Health Organization. That's exactly what President Trump said he was considering today at Tuesday's coronavirus press briefing. The New York Times reports:
> "We're going to put a hold on money spent to the W.H.O.; we're going to put a very powerful hold on it and we're going to see," Mr. Trump said, accusing the organization of having not been aggressive enough in confronting the dangers from the virus. "They called it wrong. They call it wrong. They really they missed the call." Mr. Trump appeared to be particularly angry at the W.H.O. for issuing a statement saying it did not support his decision on Jan. 31 to restrict some travel from China because of the virus. At the time, the group issued a statement saying that "restricting the movement of people and goods during public health emergencies is ineffective in most situations and may divert resources from other interventions."

"Don't close your borders to China, don't do this," Mr. Trump said, paraphrasing the group and accusing the organization of "not seeing" the outbreak when it started in Wuhan, China. "They didn't see it, how do you not see it? They didn't see it. They didn't report it. If they did see it, they must have seen it, but they didn't report." In fact, the W.H.O. repeatedly issued statements about the emergence of the virus in China and its movement around the world.

The budget for the W.H.O. is about $5 billion and comes from member countries around the world. "In 2017, the last year for which figures were available, the United States was required to spend $111 million based on the organization's rules, but sent an additional $401 million in voluntary contributions," reports The New York Times.

Trump said his government will investigate the organization and that "we will look at ending funding." It's unclear if he's planning to eliminate all funding, or only some.

## A Google Plan To Wipe Out Mosquitoes Appears to Be Working

`2020-4-5`

An experimental program led by Google parent Alphabet to wipe out disease-causing mosquitoes succeeded in nearly eliminating them from three test sites in California's Central Valley. From a report: 

> Stamping out illness caused by mosquitoes is one of Alphabet unit Verily's most ambitious public-health projects. The effort appears to be paying off, according to a paper published in the journal Nature Biotechnology on Monday. Verily is also running coronavirus triage and testing in parts of California. Bradley White, the lead scientist on the Debug initiative, said mosquito-suppression is even more important during the pandemic, so that outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever donâ(TM)t further overwhelm hospitals. Since 2017, the company has released millions of lab-bred Aedes aegypti male mosquitoes into several Fresno County neighborhoods during mosquito season. The insects are bred in Verily labs to be infected with a common bacterium called Wolbachia. When these male mosquitoes mate with females in the wild, the offspring never hatch. In results of the trial published on Monday, Verily revealed that throughout the peak of the 2018 mosquito season, from July to October, Wolbachia-infected males successfully suppressed more than 93% of the female mosquito population at field test sites. Only female mosquitoes typically bite.

## 女性的生存优势

`2020-4-10`

随着新冠病毒的传播不断跨越国界、海洋和大陆，有一个令人困惑的数据至今仍未能得到合理解释：几乎在所有有数据支持的国家，死于该病毒的男性都多于女性。对于这种差异的解释主要集中在行为方面：抽更多烟、不愿寻求适当及时的医疗服务、不爱洗手，这些绝对会影响什么样的人受到最严重的打击。但在这些解释中，有一点被忽视了：男性死于新冠病毒的比例高于女性并不是一种异常现象。更确切地说，它可能及时而引人瞩目地证明了一个直到最近都被低估的科学事实：在生存方面，男性是较为弱势的性别。这种天生的生物优势在人类生活的各个年龄阶段都很明显：女婴总是更有可能活到一周岁；如今 80% 的百岁老人是女性；活到 110 岁高龄的老人中，女性的比例达到惊人的 95%。一般来说，基因意义上的男性肌肉更发达、身材更高、体型更大、身体更强壮，但在从出生到晚年遇到的种种身体方面的困难方面，基因意义上的女性几乎总是比基因意义上的男性更能克服过去

## 第二波规模更大的蝗灾正影响非洲

`2020-4-19`

新冠病毒在世界各地爆发之际，非洲国家遭遇了第一波蝗灾。在上个月的一场大雨过后，该地区又遭遇了第二波蝗灾 (https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/04/africas-huge-locust-swarms-are-growing-at-the-worst-time/)，其规模是第一波的 20 倍。蝗群以谷物为食，已从非洲渗透进入也门和波斯湾，并抵达了伊朗沿海。新一波的蝗灾严重冲击了肯尼亚、埃塞俄比亚和索马里。这是一个糟糕的时节，因为农民刚播种完，秧苗刚刚长出，席卷而来的蝗灾让今年的收获基本上颗粒无收。联合国粮农组织称，蝗灾对粮食安全和生计构成了“前所未有的威胁”。加上新冠疫情，这个时机正是再糟糕不过了。沙漠蝗的聚集和繁殖与雨水息息相关，蝗虫只能在潮湿的沙子里产卵，干燥的沙子会把它们烤熟。在一场暴雨之后，蝗虫会大肆产卵，一平米的沙地可能会有多达一千个卵。当它们孵化出来，会把周围的食物席卷而空，然后一起飞走寻找新的食物。Media (https://img.solidot.org//0/446/liiLIZF8Uh6yM.jpg)

## 人类考古记录充满了犬类的粪便

考古学家 Melinda Zeder 始终忘不了早年的一次[考古经历](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/04/archaeological-record-full-dog-poop)。1981 年当时还是研究生的 Zeder 正在整理位于伊朗西南部一个旧石器时代洞穴中的动物骨骼，她发现了一块无法辨认的碎片。“当你难以区分石头和骨头时，就用舌头放在上面来辨别。”Zeder 说，如果碎片是骨头，它会粘住舌头。Zeder 确实那样做了，但碎片并不粘舌，却开始溶解。她非常不解，向更有经验的同事求助，那名同事笑了：“那是鬣狗的粪便。”这种饱经岁月的古老粪便可以徘徊数千年不毁，它甚至能够保留其原始的形状和颜色。考古学家通常可以根据大小和其他属性区分人类和动物粪便。但事实证明，狗的粪便很难与人类的区别开来，这可能会阻碍研究人员重建古人的饮食习惯。而考古记录中充满了[犬类的粪便](http://news.sciencenet.cn/htmlnews/2020/4/438636.shtm)。Media (https://img.solidot.org//0/446/liiLIZF8Uh6yM.jpg)

## The Many Languages Missing From the Internet

Imagine your favourite social media platform does not let you post in English. Now think of a keyboard that won't allow you to type in your own words. You would have two options: either switch to another language or remain digitally silent. This is the reality for most people that speak indigenous languages and dialects. From a report: 

> There are nearly 7,000 languages and dialects in the world, yet only 7% are reflected in published online material, according to Whose knowledge?, a campaign that aims to make visible the knowledge of marginalized communities online. While Facebook supports up to 111 languages, making it the most multilingual online platform, a survey published by Unesco in 2008 found that 98% of the internet's web pages are published in just 12 languages, and more than half of them are in English. This reduces linguistic diversity online to a handful of tongues, making it harder for those that speak one of the excluded languages of the internet.

## 昆虫数量自 1990 年以来减少了四分之一

`2020-4-24`

至今对全球昆虫丰度最大规模的评估显示，全球昆虫数量自 1990 年以来减少了约[四分之一](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/23/insect-numbers-down-25-since-1990-global-study-finds)。昆虫是数量种类最多的动物，是生态系统的重要组成部分，它们为植物授粉，成为其它生物的食物，回收自然界的垃圾。科学家警告，如果不遏制昆虫数量的下降，可能会对人类生存造成灾难性的影响。[研究报告](https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aax9931)发表在《科学》期刊上。领导这项研究的 Roel van Klink 指出，人们必须记住我们的食物真的依赖于昆虫。van Klink 称，研究发现了一个让人震惊的现象：自然保护区内的昆虫情况只比保护区外略好，这意味着保护区内也有问题存在。昆虫数量减少是栖息地破坏、杀虫剂和光污染联合驱动的。气候危机的影响在研究中并不明显。[Media](https://img.solidot.org//0/446/liiLIZF8Uh6yM.jpg)

## 生物学家发现性的新解释

`2020-4-26`

性可能是生物学中的一大难解之谜。相比无性繁殖，有性繁殖有很多缺点：需要两个个体，只能传递部分基因组，需要亲密接触容易受到伴侣的身体伤害或感染。无性的繁殖则可以在任何地方任何时间进行，能传递个体的完整基因组。尽管如此，无性繁殖却是例外而非常态：不到百分之一的植物是无性繁殖，动物中间的比率更只有千分之一。为什么有性繁殖是常态？生物学家一直在思考这个问题。1932 年遗传学家 Hermann Muller 认为他找到了答案：性能增加后代的多样性，提高身体素质，使得后代更快更强更能适合环境。性选择的这一观点至今仍然很流行。然而多样性无法解释为什么单细胞演化出性的重要组成部分：减数分裂。生物学家认为以后代作为性选择背后的重心是不完整的，性行为对个体本身同样具有潜在好处。从某种意义上说，性是无处不在的，几乎每一种真核生物也都有性。每一种性体验都是独特的，性选择的解释也不是只有一种。对动物的研究发现，雌性动物在交配之后会更容易感染，但会很快复原。相对于没有经历过性的同伴，她们的生存能力和免疫能力更强。生物学家怀疑可能是前列腺素。2018 年科学家报告对小鼠的研究发现，雄性在交配之后大脑免疫力会增强，意味着性有助于减少感染。科学家还发现，交配后的实验鼠在部分认知测试中的表现有提升，经常交配有助于减缓与年龄相关的脑功能下降。这些都是性活动的次要结果，但没有深入探索过。
